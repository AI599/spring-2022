                <p>This is a team-based, semester-long design project, in which you'll create an original crowdsourcing and social computing application on your own. You'll work in teams of 3-4 people. More information about each milestone will be added to this page. Here is the timeline and grading weights for each milestone:

                <ul>
                  <li>Team Formation (week 2): 0%</li>
                  <li>Idea (week 3): 10%</li>
                  <li>Story (week 5): 10%</li>
                  <li>Low-fi Prototype (week 7): 10%</li>
                  <li>Pitch (week 8): 20%</li>
                  <li>Mid-fi Prototype (week 10): 10%</li>
                  <li>Hi-fi Prototype (week 13): 10%</li>
                  <li>Final presentation (week 15): 15%</li>
                  <li>Final paper (week 16): 15%</li>
                </ul>
                
                Please note that all team members will receive the same grade for all the milestones. 
                </p>

                <h2>Why do this?</h2>
                <p>Now that you've mastered the arts and skills of crowdsourcing and social computing, it's important that you apply what you learned to a problem you deeply care about. It's a great way to learn further, and potentially make impact.</p>

                <h2>Does my project idea qualify?</h2>
                Projects are open-ended, so please be creative. But here are some requirements: 
                <ul>
                  <li>Your project should involve a <strong> VOLUNTARY OR INTRINSICALLY MOTIVATED CROWD</strong>, which means you cannot use paid crowds (e.g., MTurk, Upwork).</li>
                  <!-- <li>Your project should include some quality control or aggregation component.</li> -->
                  <li>Your project should have some user interface. I'm expecting most projects to be a novel crowdsourcing and social computing system that can be tested by others (e.g., a prototype website or a mobile app). Data mining or analysis focused projects are okay, but there needs to be some visualization or analytics dashboard component that is accessible by others to understand your results.</li>
                  <li>Your prototype doesn't need to be a fully implemented platform, menaing that it needs to focus on the core crowdsourcing / social computing concept you're introducing, rather than to build all the database backend, login, etc.</li>
                  <li>Connecting to your own research is encouraged, but please make sure to talk to course staff early about how to make it happen.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Examples</h2>
                Here's the <a href="https://kixlab.org/courses/cs492-fall-2016/projects/index.html">project gallery from the 2016 class</a>.

                <h2>How do we submit?</h2>
                <p>We'll create an assignment in <a href="http://klms.kaist.ac.kr/course/view.php?id=61577">KLMS</a> for each milestone.</p>

                <h2>Late Policy</h2>
                <p>For each milestone deadline, all members of your team will lose 10% for each late day. Submissions will be accepted until three days after the deadline. After then you'll get 0 on that assignment. Please note that late submissions for midterm and final presentations are not allowed.</p>

                <h2>What do I do?</h2>
                <p>You'll need to find teammates to work on an exciting project this semester. Each team should have 4 people by default. In exceptional cases we'll accept 3-person teams.
                </p>

                <h2>How do I find teammates?</h2>
                <p>Here are three methods you can use:

                <ul>
                <li>You can use <a href="https://piazza.com/kaist.ac.kr/fall2017/cs492/home">Piazza</a> to post advertisements for finding teammates.</li>
                <li>We'll give 5 minutes at the end of two classes for in-person team formation.</li> 
                <li>Use office hours to talk to us about project ideas so that we can make connections, and you can also run into other classmates.</li>
                </ul>
                
                Please try to have diversity in your own team crowd, in terms of skillset, interest, and background.

                <h2>What do we do?</h2>
                <p>In a team, you'll identify a problem that you'd like to tackle with your project, and brainstorm approaches to solving the problem.
                </p>

                <h2>Your report</h2>
                <p>In your report, please answer the following questions:
                <ol>
                  <li>What is the problem your team is trying to solve? (one sentence)</li>

                  <li>How do you know this problem exists? Why is this problem important? Include both (1) external references (e.g., academic papers, news articles, or published surveys), as well as (2) internal investigation (e.g., results from making observations, personal experiences, or interviews with target requesters or workers). (maximum one paragraph)</li>

                  <li>Why use crowdsourcing or social computing for the problem? Why not use machines or individual experts? (maximum one paragraph)</li>

                  <li>For the identified problem, discuss with your teammates what specific challenges exist. State these challenges as <strong>"How might we..."</strong> (HMW) questions. HMW questions serve as a bridge between the identified problem and solution ideas. They are short questions that should be broad enough to allow for open ideas yet narrow enough to set meaningful boundaries. Report <strong>at least 10 HMW questions</strong> for your team's problem, and pick <strong>top 3 HMW questions</strong>. <a href="https://dschool-old.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/HMW-METHODCARD.pdf">This method card</a> from Stanford d.school should be a useful resource.
              
                  <li>
                    <strong>Solution Ideas</strong>: Solution ideas are your attempts at solving the HMW questions. In your team, discuss how you might address these questions with crowdsourcing or social computing. Report <strong>at least 10 solution ideas</strong> per each of the top 3 HMW questions, and pick <strong>top 3 solution ideas</strong> overall. Note that these 3 ideas should be <strong>distinct from one another</strong>, covering a wide solution space. The best ideas don't necessarily have to represent each HMW; multiple ideas can belong to a single HMW.
                  </li>

                <h2>What do we do?</h2>
                <p>Your team will now further develop the ideas that you came up with in Milestone #1. You'll create two types of artifacts that will capture your design process. Please follow the order presented below.
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Tasks</strong>: Based on the three solution ideas your team came up with, brainstorm three major <em>tasks</em> your solution wants to support. Tasks represent what the user (including but not limited to crowd workers, requesters, or community members) wants to achieve, rather than specific system features or UI elements. For each task, list three <strong>requirements or design goals</strong> that a solution should support. Some tips:
                      <ul>
                        <li>Make sure the three tasks are distinct from one another and cover different levels of complexity.</li>
                        <li>Be specific, and include details and context. <em>"The user wants to learn math."</em> is way too broad. Think about a particular user with their likely demographic, constraints, and motivation: <em>"Seung Hyun, a 20-year old college student, wants to learn Chinese in his spare time. While he doesn't have time to take classes or get a private tutor, he wants to use his commute time to learn useful words and phrases."</em></li>
                      </ul>
                  </li>

                  <li>
                    <strong>Storyboards</strong>: Create <strong>3 storyboard sketches</strong>, one for each of the three tasks you identified. A storyboard is a set of comic-strip-like drawings that visually walks through a concrete scenario and a task that your user experiences. Show the challenge the user encounters, what environment the user is surrounded by, what motivates the user to use the solution idea you're suggesting, and how your solution idea actually addresses the challenge. The storyboard shouldn't be about specific system features or UI elements. You don't even need to show the detailed screen layout of your UI at this point. Focus on the concept and context, rather than pretty UIs or sophisticated system features.

                      <ul>
                        <li>Make sure to hand-draw your storyboards, with a thick pen so that sketches are visible when digitally scanned and excessive details are not included. Using a pencil or a thin ball-point pen is not allowed. </li>
                        <li>Here are some good examples (<a href="https://kixlab.org/courses/crowdsourcing/projects/verbivore/tasks-sketches-video/index.html">Verbivore</a> and <a href="https://kixlab.org/courses/crowdsourcing/projects/letsread/tasks-sketches-video/index.html">Let's Read</a>), except for the fact that some of them are not drawn with a thick pen. </li>
                        <li>Resources: Amal Dar Aziz's <a href="http://hci.stanford.edu/courses/cs147/2009/assignments/storyboard_notes.pdf">guide to storyboarding</a> is a highly recommended resource. Also, watch the first 6 minutes of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgEm67KLIIM">this video</a> by Scott Klemmer, which gives a nice introduction to storyboarding.</li>
                      </ul>
                  </li>

                  <!-- <li><strong>Video</strong>: Now turn your three storyboards into a concept video that illustrates the three tasks. Some tips:
                    <ul>
                      <li>You need to set the stage: Start with a user and their context and problem. Do not show the UI sketches from the beginning.</li>
                      <li>You can include rough UI sketches to demonstrate how the user might perform the task using your system, but they need to be rough and in low fidelity.</li>
                      <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=cs147+concept+video">Some examples here</a>.</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li> -->
                </ul>
                </p>

                <h2>Your report</h2>

                <h2>What do I do?</h2>
                <p>Now you have a clear idea and concrete tasks and scenarios to support in your crowdsourcing application. Let's start prototyping the idea!</p>

                <p>Before making something that's fully functional with a server backend and a visually pleasing interface, it's more important to first "implement" the tasks and scenarios into a prototype.</p>

                <p>Rather than use HTML and Javascript, you'll first use a prototyping tool to implement the tasks and scenarios. Specifically, we recommend <a href="https://marvelapp.com/">Marvel</a>, <a href="https://www.invisionapp.com/">InVision</a>, or <a href="https://proto.io/">proto.io</a>. You can also choose any prototyping tool of your choice.</p>

                <p>Functionlity does not need to be fully implemented. Please use hard-coded but realistic data, Wizard-of-Oz, and fake results, so that you can focus on the essential: the UI and the crowd workflow rather than the underlying implementation.</p>

                <h2>Your report</h2>
                <p>Your report should include:</p>

                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Problem Statement</strong>: Re-state the problem you're tackling in your project. Based on what you've learned so far, you can revise your problem statement.</li>
                  <li><strong>Tasks</strong>: List core tasks (one to three, at least two recommended) you've decided to support in your application. Again, you can make improvements from the initial report.</li>
                  <li><strong>Prototype</strong>:
                    <ul>
                      <li>Prototyping tool: Which tool did you choose? Why? What worked well with the tool? What didn't?</li>
                      <li>Design choices: What did you intentionally choose NOT to implement (e.g., fake or hard-coded data, manual algorithm, etc.), and why? </li>
                      <li>Representative screenshots: Include a few most important screenshots that showcase the uniqueness of your application.</li>
                      <li>Instructions: Your prototype needs to be accessible and executable by anyone with the link. Please include instructions for running your prototype in detail, if needed. Later, peer students will actually use this prototype to give you feedback.
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li><strong>User feedback</strong>: Show your prototype to THREE people (hopefully target users) outside your team. Ask them to <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/thinking-aloud-the-1-usability-tool/">think aloud</a>. Write down any usability issues and comments. List at least 10 distinct comments you received in your report. Your submitted prototype doesn't need to reflect these comments, although we encourage you to make these changes for your next iteration.</li>
                </ul>

                  <li>Walk through your interface. You can use video or screenshots, or even do a live demo. But be careful with live demos, because they require a lot of practice and include many move parts.</li>
                  <li>Show us how your deployment went. How many users did you attract? What are some collected results suggesting that your application serves the task well? What did you learn from talking to users?</li>

                <h2>What do I do?</h2>
                <p>Now that you have deployed your system for a couple weeks, seen your crowd use the system, and collected useful data, it's time to write it all up! You've already read and written responses to 30+ crowdsourcing papers, so let's write one on your project.</p>

                <h2>Suggested Outline</h2>
                <p>Find a model paper that your team really likes or is inspired by, and use it as a template. Here's a suggested outline:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Abstract</strong>: One paragraph summary of the project. This is the most important part of the paper. After reading it, a reader should understand the problem you're tacking, the approach you're taking, and the results of your evaluation.</li>
                  <li><strong>Introduction</strong>: What is the state of the world? What's the burning problem? What's your solution? What's the summary of results?</li>
                  <li><strong>Background and Related Work</strong>: What backgrond knowledge do you want your readers to have to better understand your motivation? What existing techniques or ideas are you inspired by? How does your approach differ from them?</li>
