# Project quick overview (10 mins)


# Topic Intro 1 (15 mins)

do the lottery vs fixed payment study in the beginning of class
and use this as a case study throughout the class to discuss
various factors involved in online experimentation.

Procedure
- Students do the online survey. (pick the reward type and answer the risk seeking behavior survey questions)
- Students do the brainstorming task on paper. (print the worksheet and distribute)
- Students peer evaluate the worksheet and give a final score.
- Course staff runs simple average and t-test to see if the paper results are replicated.
	- For risk-seeking behavior, average the three Likert-scale questions and see if lottery vs fixed groups differ in the aggregate score.

This week morning paper (a daily blog about CS papers) is introducing papers about the online experiment and I thought it might be helpful in your class (or presenters). Here are some links to posts.
