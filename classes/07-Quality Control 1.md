# Student Presentation
- Pictionary activity was fun

# Postmortem
- Activity needs more description. I wasn't being clear in explaining what to answer.

- Factory analogy for quality control (in the student presentation) was good.
	- Test all (crowdsourcing): easy to apply computational method
		- Also, each worker has different quality, so it's kind of necessary.
