# Post-mortem

- 10 mins not enough for the activity
	- reduce the num tasks to 1 good and 1 bad
	- also, give more guidance in the questions. Rather than just why or why not, ask
		- how does this task benefit from having lots of people?
		- why make an open call?
		- why reach out to non-experts? to humans?
		
- Open the topic presentation form after class
	- students are distracted to do it during class
