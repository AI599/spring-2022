One more minor strategy I have seen from time to time is people encouraging others to spam the B button. This is usually to counteract the trolls who just love to open the menu, completely halting progress. The idea is that if we keep pressing B, we will be able to close the menu faster every time it pops up, and keep moving on instead of sitting around and potentially wasting valuable items in the bag.

# Activity
Realtime crowdsourcing application ideas

Then pick one idea that's common / doable within a short in-class activity time frame,
and let students work on developing a workflow for supporting realtime.

=> Didn't have enough time to do a full-fledged activity for it, but was able to skim through some ideas and asked students' thoughts on how to support realtime crowdsourcing for certain ideas that seem interesting.

# Postmortem

A bit too much explanantion from me in the beginning part of the class.
