# Student Presentation
In-class iterative vs parallel workflow
- Parallel condition: form & spreadsheet
	- Form to collect answers from independent workers: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc559FlqJSmk6-26RtIQjq93a0M5HZNbJDST0xQEtb-ic6TYw/viewform
	- Google Spreadsheet to show aggregate responses (most common words): https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cjaIlQs7FeTo2xJ0JtVq6QBpgavXaIudMKtjgSe3lm8/edit#gid=91893410
- Iterative condition: on a piece of paper, see previous people's answer and add on.



# Postmortem

===
- Activity (writing down a query) needs more time.
	- Seems to work pretty well.

Motivation - why would a crowd worker do this?
Task-request cardinality - is the task-request relation 1:1, 1:N, N:1, or N:N?
Human skill - what kind of human skill is required to complete a task?
Quality control - how to ensure valid results?
Process order - in what order is the work processed between computer, worker, and requester?
Aggregation - how are results from multiple workers combined?
